# Get Started

This documentation is created to help you to use eCredits and to build on eCredits. It 
covers eCredits in general, node setup, metamask configs and will be extended.  

This is an open source documentation which you can also find on GitHub under the general 
eCredits GitHub account at <https://github.com/eCredits>.

## What is eCredits

eCredits is a public blockchain, which is based on a proven set of technologies, the Ethereum 
protocol, which is one of the most established open source blockchain protocols. This technology 
has been adopted and extended for this project, and provides the perfect foundation for building a 
rapidly growing ecosystem and can even be optimised further to accommodate the requirements for 
eCredits to become the cryptocurrency designed for everyday use.  
The eCredits Blockchain has a block-time of five seconds and is fully compatible with Ethereum and 
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Vision

The eCredits Ecosystem creates the platform of a movement consisting of local and regional micro-ecosystems 
that create, offer, and sell services and products with the help of the eCredits Blockchain. These services 
are aligned to help micro-, small and medium sized enterprises and establish parity with or even gain an edge 
over larger market players such as international multis.  

The use of eCredits Cryptocurrency generates eActivity, which constitutes a reward system that provides 
remuneration for loyal relationships. On the basis of such trusting relationships, partners will introduce a 
variety of additional services in the areas of, for instance, marketing or sales.  

The goal of eCredits Cryptocurrency is to become a currency of values, thereby creating good neighbourly 
relations as well as entrepreneurial helpfulness.


## Tokens

The eCredits ecosystem consists of two initial tokens/coins on the eCredits Blockchain: The native 
cryptocurrency ECS, which is also used to pay gas fees and eActivity â€“ a token which is a reward program 
integrated into eCredits Blockchain.
