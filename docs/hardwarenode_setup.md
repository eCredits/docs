# eCredits Hardware Node Setup

Congratulations to your new eCredits node! This node is already preconfigured with software, but you still have to maintain the node and run through the setup process. 
This documentation should guide you through the process, but please also make sure to check the [Node Setup](node_setup.md#ecredits-node-setup) and [Maintenance](node_maintenance.md#Node-Maintenance) sections.

!> **Note: You are solely responsible for your node. We do not provide any support for eCredits nodes. This includes 
but is not limited to support for setting up, maintaining or updating eCredits nodes. It's your own responsibility to 
take care of the node and it's security, keeping it up to date and to participate in the community.**

## Login Data

The standard username and password for the node is:

- Username: `ecredits`
- Password: `The peoples currency!`

?> The standard keyboard layout for the node is english. If you have e.g. a german keyboard, it means that you have to enter z instead of y.
You can find a picture of the keyboard layout at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#/media/File:Qwerty.svg>

## OS Configuration

After the first login, plesae do the basic configuration of operating system:

1. Change keyboard layout (general keyboard layout and the login keyboard layout)
2. Connect WLAN or LAN and make sure that the internet connection works
3. Change the default password by opening a terminal and type `passwd`
4. Update the system by opening a terminal and execute `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`. The system will ask you if you want to restart docker - select yes.
5. execute `sed -i -e 's/\r$//' /usr/local/bin/ecredits` which fixes a potential issue in the script that some users faced.

## Setup eCredits Node

The hardware node sold via the official eCredits webshop has a preinstalled command that allows you to perform the operations on the node. Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
ecredits
```

This command updates itself, downloads the required files and starts the validator:

```shell

Existing eCredits setup identified. Please choose an option:
```

Please select option **5**. The system will guide you through the process, will ask you to create a new public address (if you dont have one), to set a password, will ask you if you want to use the etherbase address and will finally ask you to start mining. 

?> If you want to use a separate account for your rewards, please set the etherbase address to the address of your wallet. By doing that, all rewards (transaction costs) that 
your validator receives will be added to this configured address.

Once the system created the key, it will ask you for the public Account address:

```shell
Your new key was generated

Public address of the key:   0x0215414CEF8F44C47ab15A29656214e6AeA28B00
Path of the secret key file: /root/.ethereum/keystore/UTC--2022-05-13T16-01-00.501763473Z--0215414cef8f44c47ab15a29656214e6aea28b00

- You can share your public address with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your funds!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to access account funds!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!

To start the mining, please provide the public Account address (e.g. 0xTODO0000ENTER000YOUR000ADDRESS000HERE000):
```

The public account address is the one shown in line 3 of the output, so in the sample above, it would be `0x0215414CEF8F44C47ab15A29656214e6AeA28B00`.  
This is the address of your validator and the one that you need to send the community or the SCE if you apply to become a validator. 

!> Please create a backup of this key and make sure you remember your password. In case of an issue (e.g. hard disc crashes), you need a backup to be able to start a new 
validator and to access your funds (if you do not use the etherbase address). 

Create a backup of the file by navigating to: `/root/.ethereum/keystore/` and then copy the file to e.g. a usb stick or another secure place.  

Next step is to [Apply as validator](node_setup.md#Apply-as-validator) and wait for the acceptance.  

Once your validator is accepted, it will start mining. You can check the status by using **10** (Show logs). If a block is potentially mined, the log message will be:

```shell
INFO [01-02|12:34:56.789] ðŸ”¨ mined potential block                  number=3,360,123 hash=3fa29a..b13e92
```
